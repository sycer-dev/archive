## Sycer Development Archive

On February 19th, 2022, Sycer Development [announced](https://twitter.com/Fykowo/status/1493258304948084736?s=20&t=9slPFN_4b5KEjsqDe6yYhA&utm_source=archive) the termination of all subscription and lifetime services.

This repository is home to four (4) of our now retired services on separate branches:
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/sycer-dev/archive/tree/toolkit)
- [Carts Distribution](https://github.com/sycer-dev/archive/tree/carts)
- [SMS](https://github.com/sycer-dev/archive/tree/sms)
- [Success Testimonials](https://github.com/sycer-dev/archive/tree/success)*
- [Hypervisor](https://github.com/sycer-dev/archive/tree/hypervisor)*  
\*in progress

In the hopes of [*preserving open source software for generations*](https://archiveprogram.github.com/), I'm making a slew of our services open-source to provide a valuable resource and, hopefully, a source of motivation for future developers.

The above services are provided as-is with zero future maintainance under the MIT license.
Support will not be provided with self-hosting or updating the projects to current or future dependency versions.
