## Sycer Development Archive

On February 19th, 2022, Sycer Development [announced](https://twitter.com/Fykowo/status/1493258304948084736?s=20&t=9slPFN_4b5KEjsqDe6yYhA&utm_source=archive) the termination of all subscription and lifetime services.

This repository is home to seven (7) of our now retired services on separate branches:
- [Toolkit]()
- [Carts Distribution]()
- [SMS Origional]()
- [SMS Next]()
- [Success Testimonials]()
- [Alerts]()
- [Pinger]()

In the hopes of [*preserving open source software for generations*](https://archiveprogram.github.com/), I'm making a slew of our services open-source to provide a valuable resource and, hopefully, a source of motivation for future developers.

The above services are provided as-is with zero future maintainance under the MIT license.
Support will not be provided with self-hosting or updating the projects to current or future dependency versions.
